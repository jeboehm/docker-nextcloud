# docker-nextcloud
This uses the official [Nextcloud docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud/) to build a new image
on top of [jeboehm/php-nginx-base](https://hub.docker.com/r/jeboehm/php-nginx-base/).
With this solution you have the benefit of a small, fast and reliable setup using official
Nextcloud components.

You may use [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy/) as a frontend proxy.
